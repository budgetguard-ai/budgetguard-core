# API Documentation

BudgetGuard exposes its REST API using an OpenAPI specification generated at runtime.
Open the Swagger UI at [`/docs`](../docs) when the server is running to interact with
endpoints and inspect schemas.

The raw OpenAPI JSON is available at [`/docs/json`](../docs/json) and can be
downloaded for use with other tools.
